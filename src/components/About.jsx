        <p>
          After graduating university in 2021, I took a gap year to develop my
          skills to become more marketable. I took a great interested in tech
          and I decided to take the plunge into learning programming. Since
          then, it has become my passion to programme and I hope to become the
          best that I can be in web development.{" "}
